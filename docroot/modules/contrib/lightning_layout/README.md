## Lightning Layout

Lightning Layout provides modules and configuration for great layout authoring
experiences. It uses the core Layout Builder module to enable a drag-and-drop
experience when laying out pages.

### Components
Lightning Layout's components are not enabled by default. You can install them
like any other Drupal modules.

#### Landing Page (`lightning_landing_page`)
Provides a minimal "Landing page" content type which is configured out of the 
box to be customizable and visually editable using the drag-and-drop layout
builder.

#### Banner Block (`lightning_banner_block`)
Provides a custom block type called "Banner", which has an image and body text,
which is displayed on top of the image.

#### Map Block (`lightning_map_block`)
Provides a custom block type called "Google Map", which displays an interactive
Google Map centered on a particular location or address.
